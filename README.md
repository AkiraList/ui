# stable-ui

Stable UI is a web user interface designed to generate, save, and view images using Stable Diffusion, with the goal being able to provide Stable Diffusion to anyone.

This is achieved using [Stable Horde](https://stablehorde.net/), a crowdsourced distributed cluster of Stable Diffusion workers, which makes this tool available for anyone to use regardless if they don't have the processing power to run Stable Diffusion themselves.
